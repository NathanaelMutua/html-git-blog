    <p>Dive in with me, let's undertand the basics of Git.</p>
    <p>This webpage contains what we learnt in our Teach2Give Git training session, and research I have come to aquire. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>1. Getting started</h2>
    <p>First let's create a folder, this is where your project or file to be <i>versioned</i> will live, like the way we did for the <a href="https://github.com/codeme254/programming-quotes">programming jokes repository</a></p>
    <p>Next we will need to open the command prompt in the particular file</p>

    <h2>2. What is Git</h2>
    <p>Git is the most popular <i>version control system</i>, it really helps us keep track of different versions of a given project or document.</p>
    
    <h3>Introduction to Version Control</h3>
    <p>Version control, as it says itself is all about keeping track of versions - That's prolly how I'd put it in laymans terms.</p>
    <p>Version control systems, which I found out are sometimes called source code management(SCM) or revision control systems(RCS)</p>
    <p>Version control allows many members to work collaboratively on a project, even of they are not in the same place.</p>

    <h4>Versioning</h4>
    <p>As I've come to learn versioning is the creation and management of multiple product releases</p>
    <p>This is signified through versioning numbers, such as: v2.2.1</p>
    <strong>Meaning of each digit</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>"v<b>2.</b>.2.1": This is a MAJOR change in a version</li>
        <li>"v2.<b>2</b>.1": This usually represents a patch release, usually having minor features.</li>
        <li>"v2.2.<b>1</b>": This represents a patch release, it is usually just basic bug fixes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Git was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvald</a>, the creator of the Linux Kernel, in 2005 in response to a liscence dispute with BitKeeper - a version control system at the time. Linus Torvald created Git in 10 days to provide a free, fast alternative to BitKeeper</p>
    <P>On December 21<sup>st</sup>, 2005, Git had its first major release.</P>
    <p>Today(on the day of publishing) the latest version of Git is 2.49.0</p>

    <h3>Why Use Git</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Helps us keep track of changes made by different members</li>
        <li>Tracking of changes makes going back to a stable version easier.</li>
        <li>It ensures better communication and organization</li>
        <li>Allows for many members to work on the same project - collaboration.</li>
        <li>Branching and merging allows people to create seperate branches, which they can work on seperately, before requesting to be merged to the main branch - combine changes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. Installing Git</h2>
    <!-- Here I kinda had to visit the official site to cross-reference -->
    <!-- This is where I got additional information -->
    <p>As indicated in the Git documentation, one can download as a package or via another installer. I highly recommend the autommated installation.</p>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>The instructions are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit the official website: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Downloading Git for Windows</a></li>
        <li>Select the standalone installer (If you want to download onto your desktop) or the portable edition (if you want to have the installer in a seperate or external storage)</li>
        <li>After the installer file has been downloaded, execute it</li>
        <li>
            Usually a system permission pop up appears - Allow it, then follow the following step-by-step instructions
            <ol>
                <li><b>Information-Public liscence page:</b> Click next for this section - I know I did</li>
                <li>Review selected components: This is based on preference, but ensure all the necessary boxes are checked</li>
                <li><b>Choosing the default editor used by Git:</b> I preferably leave it as is, because we can configure it later using</li>
                <li><b>Adjusting name of initial branch:</b> This is yet again about preference, but many teams are migrating to main as the default branch</li>
                <li><b>Adjusting PATH environment:</b> I'd leave it as default, but take note of it, as we will probably need it for troubleshooting purposes</li>
                <li><b>Choosing SSH executable:</b> I went with the Bundled Open SSH, but I've come to learn that if one needs specific features, has existing setup, needs troubleshooting, then External OpenSSH comes in clutch</li>
                <li><b>Choosing HTTPS transport backend:</b> I'd leave as is</li>
                <li><b>Configuring line ending conversions:</b> I'd leave as is</li>
                <li><b>Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash:</b> I'd leave as is</li>
                <li><b>Choosing default behavior of git pull:</b> I'd leave as is by default</li>
                <li><b>Choosing a credential helper:</b> I'd leave as is</li>
                <li><b>Configuring extra options</b>, these are cache options: Decide as you may prefer</li>
                <li>Installation: Lastly click on the 'Install' button</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>I learnt that you can also just run this <mark><b>'sudo dnf install git-all'</b></mark> command in the command prompt(As Administrator)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Verifying Installation</h3>
    <p>After installation, it is important to check if you now have git in your system</p>
    <p>This is by running <mark><b>git --version</b></mark> or <mark><b>git version</b></mark> or <mark><b>git -v</b></mark> in the terminal</p>
    <p>This should let you know if you have git appropriately installed</p>

    <h2>4. Configuring Git</h2>
    <p>I wil briefely talk about basic configurations, but for detailed information you can visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config">git</a></p>
    <p>A list of all the available cofiguration variables can easily be accessed using the <mark><b>git help --config</b></mark></p>

    <!-- This part is something I came to find out in my research, learning is 80% outside the classroom -->
    <h3>Configuration Levels</h3>
    <p>In my google research I discovered that you can configure settings to apply to a specific area selectively, as such listed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>System-Wide Configuration</li>
        <li>User-Specific Configuration</li>
        <li>Repository -Specific Configuration</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>System-Wide Configuration</h4>
    <p>These settings, as I have discovered apply to every user on the system</p>
    <p>Usually declared as follows: <mark><b>git config --system 'key' 'value'</b></mark></p>

    <h4>User-Specific Configuration</h4>
    <p>These settings apply to a single user and are stored in the /.gitconfig file.</p>
    <p>It uses the global flag: <b>--global</b></p>
    <p>Declared as: <mark><b>git config --global 'key' 'value'</b></mark></p>

    <h4>Repository -Specific Configuration</h4>
    <p>These settings apply only to the current repository and are stored in the <b>.git/config</b> file</p>
    <p>Declared as: <mark><b>git config 'key' 'value'</b></mark></p>

    <h3>Basic Configuration Commands</h3>
    <p>We will be going through the basics, namely:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Setting username and email</li>
        <li>Customizing default text editor</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting username and email</h3>
    <p>One usually needs to identify themselves before making any commit, this is usually the author's name and email address</p>
    <p>To declare that identity for all repositories we use <mark><b>git config --global</b></mark></p>
    <p>This will store the settings in the user's <b>.gitconfig</b> file </p>
    
    <p>We will use the following to configure username and email:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><mark><b>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</b></mark></li>
        <li><mark><b>gi config --global user.email examplemail@mail.com</b></mark></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Customizing Default text editor</h3>
    <p>Customizing and configuring the prefered text editor, let's us determine what we will use for various tasks such as writting and editing commit messages</p>
    <p>Here we will use the command below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><mark><b>git config --global core.editor "Name of Editor"</b></mark></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For configuring the default editor for a specific repository we use the following command. As seen previously, this usually doesn't have the global flag</p>
    <ul>
        <li><mark><b>git config core.editor "Name of Editor</b></mark></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The names of editors can be as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>VS Code: "code --wait"</li>
        <li>vim: "vim"</li>
        <!-- I think I saw the vim editor selection in the setup menu -->
        <li>emac: "emac"...I guess this is a type of editor - Though I have not really heard about it</li>
        <li>There are the other more common ones, such as notepad</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Initializing a Git Repository</h2>
    <p>A repository, as we were taught is a workplace which tracks and manages files within a folder. We can have as many repos as we want on our machine, all with seperate history and content, however, it is important to note that the project should have a single Git repository</p>

    <h3>Using <b>git init</b></h3>
    <p>To initialize a git repository, we run the following command, in the command prompt with the target file directory open</p>
    <p>Command: <mark><b>git init</b></mark></p>
    <p>This command is only done once, this creates the .git file in the target repo</p>

    <h3>Understanding .git directory</h3>
    <p>To confirm whether the project has a git repository or not, we use the <b>git status</b> command. when you run the <b>git status</b> command and get the  message "fata: not a git repository...", it means the project lacks a git repo. You can go ahead and initialize a repo.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Adding files to the staging area</h2>
    <p>This generally means preping modified files for a commit. This allows us to organize our changes into meaningful groups before commiting them</p>
    <p>Before we add anything to the staging area, our instructor informed us that we must first confirm if there is anything to add using <mark><b>git status</b></mark></p>

    <h3>Using <b>git add .</b> command</h3>
    <p>This command stages all the changes.</p>
    <p>Command: <mark><b>git add .</b></mark></p>

    <h3>Adding specific files</h3>
    <p>To stage specific files, we use the format <b>'git add "file_path"'</b></p>
    <p>Command: <mark><b>git add file.txt</b></mark></p>

    <h3>Adding all changes</h3>
    <p>To stage all files we use <b>git add -a</b>, which stages all changes, modifications and new files</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Command: <mark><b>git add -a</b></mark></li>
    </ul>

    <p>On the other hand, I came to realise that if you only want to stage modified and deleted files only, we can use the <i>-u flag</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Command: <mark><b>git add -u</b></mark></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>7. Commiting Changes</h2>
    <p>This is a really important part, a commit is generally a checkpoint to your project at a particular time</p>
    <p>we use the <i><b>commit</b></i> function</p>

    <h3>Writing Commit Messages</h3>
    <p>This involves having a message to accompany the checkpoint, it let;s others know what changes were made and what to expect</p>
    <p>There are 2 ways to make commit messages</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct commit message: this is usually a short message entered in the terminal</li>
        <li>Detailed text editor commit message: this usually needs too be edited in the selected text editor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are the commands to execute the above respectively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct commit message: <mark><b>git commmit -m "Message to be filled here"</b></mark></li>
        <li>git commit</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Amending commits</h3>
    <p>I did some research, and found that this is a way to modify the most recent commit made in the branch</p>
    <p>We can do so like this: <mark><b>git commit --amend -m "New updated commit message"</b></mark></p>
    
    <h2>8. Branches</h2>
    <p>Branches are like alternative timelines of a project</p>

    <h2>9. Creating a Branch</h2>
    <p>We can create a branch using the command <mark><b>git branch NEW_BRANCH_NAME</b></mark></p>

    <h2>10. viewing all branches</h2>
    <p>To view all branches we carry out the command <mark><b>git branch</b></mark>, this gives a list of all branches, with the active branch being highlighted.</p>

    <h2>11. Switching active branches</h2>
    <p>To switch between branches we use the command <mark><b>git switch TARGET_BRANCH_NAME</b></mark></p>
    
    
    <h2>12. Merging a branch</h2>

    <h2>13. Deleting a branch</h2>
