    <h2>What is Git</h2>
    <p>Git is the most popular <i>version control system</i>, it really helps us keep track of different versions of a given project or document.</p>
    
    <h3>Introduction to Version Control</h3>
    <p>Version control, as ot says itself is all about keeping track of versions - That's prolly how I'd put it in laymans terms.</p>
    <p>Version control systems, which I found out are sometimes called source code management(SCM) or revision control systems(RCS)</p>
    <p>Version control allows many members to work collaboratively on a project, even of they are not in the same place.</p>

    <h4>Versioning</h4>
    <p>As I've come to learn versioning is the creation and management of multiple product releases</p>
    <p>This is signified through versioning numbers, such as: v2.2.1</p>
    <strong>Meaning of each digit</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>"<b>2.</b>.2.1": This is a MAJOR change in a version</li>
        <li>"2.<b>2</b>.1": This usually represents a patch release, usually having minor features.</li>
        <li>"2.2.<b>1</b>": This represents a patch release, it is usually just basic bug fixes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Git was created by Linus Torvald, the creator of the Linux Kernel, in 2005 in response to a liscence dispute with BitKeeper - a version control system at the time. Linus Torvald created Git in 10 days to provide a free, fast alternative to BitKeeper</p>
    <P>On December 21<sup>st</sup>, 2005, Git had its first major release.</P>
    <p>Today(on the day of publishing) the latest version of Git is 2.49.0</p>

    <h3>Why Use Git</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Helps us keep track of changes made by different members</li>
        <li>Tracking of changes makes going back to a stable version easier</li>
        <li>It ensures better communication and organization</li>
        <li>Allows for many members to work on the same project simultaneously</li>
        <li>Branching and merging allows people to create seperate branches, which they can work on seperately, before requesting to be merged to the main branch.</li>
    </ol>
